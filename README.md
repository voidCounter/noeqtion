A browser extension that converts LaTeX-style equations to Notion's native math blocks.

Notion still hasn't implemented automatic equation rendering for pasted text. If you've ever copied notes with mathematical equations into Notion, you know the pain. Those beautiful `$E=mc^2$` expressions just sit there as plain text. This extension fixes that just with a keyboard shortcut.

## Features

- **Automatic Conversion**: Detects both inline (`$...$`) and display (`$$...$$`) equations
- **Keyboard Shortcut**: Convert all equations on the page with `Ctrl+Alt+M` (or use the extension popup)

That's it.

## How to Use

1. Install the extension in your browser
2. Open a Notion page with LaTeX equations (like `$O(n)$` or `$$\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}dx$$`)
3. Press `Ctrl+Alt+M` (or click the extension icon and hit "Convert")
4. Watch your equations transform into Notion's native math format

## Supported Browsers

- **Firefox**: Fully tested and working
- **Chrome**: Fully tested and working
- **Other Chromium-based browsers**: Probably work, but not tested

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone or download this repository
2. For Firefox:
   - Open `about:debugging`
   - Click "This Firefox" â†’ "Load Temporary Add-on"
   - Select the `manifest.json` file
3. For Chrome:
   - Open `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the extension folder

## Technical Notes

The extension uses Notion's existing shortcuts and features to create math blocks. For display equations (`$$...$$`), it uses the `/math` command. For inline equations (`$...$`), it converts them to Notion's inline format by wrapping them as `$$...$$`.

To reduce visual distraction during conversion, the extension temporarily hides math dialogs using injected CSS. It processes equations sequentially, rescanning the DOM after each conversion to handle Notion's dynamic content updates.

The extension doesn't inject custom UI or modify Notion's core behavior. It automates what you'd do manually, just much faster.
